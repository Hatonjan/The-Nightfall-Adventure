***The Nightfall Adventure***
The journey to return the light to the world.

**Project description:**
The Nightfall Adventure is a video game developed as part of the Introduction to Programming class. It is intended to be both fun and challenging for the user. I have implemented everything I have learned in the class and a little extra to make it more visually appealing, such as the rotating collectables. That was a challenge, but I was able to complete what I had in mind.

**Controls**
`a` Moves to the left
`d` Moves to the right
`w` Jumps

*I include a fighting mode to allow the game character to interact with enemies*
`Arrow left` Activates fighting mode to the left
`Arrow right` Activates fighting mode to the right
`Arrow left` + `a` Strike to the left
`Arrow right` + `d` Strike to the right
